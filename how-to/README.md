# How-to

## Current documentation

The documentation is available in the following languages:

*   :de: [German](vu-piconloader_de.md)
*   :us: [English](vu-piconloader_en.md)

## Archived documentation

The original and outdated how-to files in plain text files can be found inside the `archive` sub-directory. Initially the documentation was written in German language, as the *Vu-PiconLoader* (formerly just *PiconLoader*) project was first uploaded into a German forum for the satellite receiver. Later, those instructions have been translated to English, but not one-to-one.
